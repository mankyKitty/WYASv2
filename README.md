Write Yourself a Scheme
=======================

This is my WIP rewrite of the wonderful book 'Write Yourself a Scheme', originally by Jonathan Tang. 
Subsequently turned into a WikiBook of the same name [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours).

Over time the book has not kept up with changes in the Haskell landscape, this is an attempt to rectify that. The 
book will be brought up to date with new techniques and packages. The methods used will be expanded upon as it
develops into a more modern and useful Haskell guide.
